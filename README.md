# PhishingCampaign

For this exercise, malicious emails were sent to the users, under the pretext that the client was going to have a give away, and the users would be given a ticket worth $450 pesos, in addition to an extra 35% discount if they purchased another ticket, all this following the instruction to register on the site by clicking on the image. 
The apocryphal site to which they were redirected, had visual attributes alluding to their login page, and other indicators, with the intention that the user could identify that he was not entering the official site, but a fake one with the aim of stealing credentials with malicious motives. 
This phishing campaign was carried out for 2 days.
